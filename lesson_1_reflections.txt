How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It helped me easily identify which lines were modified by the + and - symbols

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    If a newer version is buggy I could easily switch back to the older stable one

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    While manually choosing when to commit we can seperate out the logical changes
    from the unnessecary ones but sometimes a judjgment call may be subject to human
    error and autosaving could be advantageous.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    This is really required for more than one files that are highly dependent on
    each other and are collectively responible for a certain application.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    find the commit ID using git log and the lines modified using git commit and
    ID of that commint and the previous one.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    If a newer version is buggy I could easily switch back to the older stable one

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    All my codes and projects in the future!
