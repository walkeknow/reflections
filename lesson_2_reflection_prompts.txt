What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
    
    .git directory is added in it

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
    
    A staging area provides a confirmation stage before we can actually commit the 
    file in our local repository to our git branch.

    Also if we discover something that we do not want to commit while in the staging
    area, we could remove the file from the area using reset or delete the file
    altogether using reset --hard

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
    
    git diff --staged will compare the version in our staging area to the last 
    commited version.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

Branches could help in primarily two cases:
  - Making an experimental change which we do not want to include in our main code 
    but still want it to be released and accesible to the public
  - Creating different versions from the same code eg. two similar apps like Word
    Cookies and Word Crossword that use the same parent code

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

    The diagrams help in knowing the parents of a particular branch so that a branch
    can be merged accordingly in the future with master without being isolated, also 
    branches have specific names to them making them easier to merge by name and 
    not id

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

    Merging two branches can add or remove data from the code, we can resolve it
    by opening the file where there is a conflict if any by modifying the
    appropriate highlighted lines

What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?

    Git's automatic merging could be disadvantageous as it may modify some sensetive
    code which is not what the user may have wanted.
