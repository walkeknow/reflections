When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    To collaborate with other people

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    This could publish code which is still in development and not meant to be viewed
    by others

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    branches-   creating a seperate version of our own code (a different language or 
                an experiment). A branch can be created as git branch [branch-name]
                After a branch is merged it can/should be deleted using git 
                branch -d [branch-name]
 
    clones  -   copying a repository using a remote or copying a local repository
                as it is, does not update changes to GitHub after modifications
    
    forks   -   cloning a Git repository into any of your own git repository, no 
                changes are made to the local machine unless git pull is executed, 
                in which case the origin-master is updated

                A code should be forked when we want to create our version of someone's
                code while letting them know it and directly updating on GitHub rather
                than cloning and then pushing

                Forks are publicly visible

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    Having a copy of the last known state of a remote stored locally (using git fetch)
    would update the remote (origin-master) but will not update master, so if we
    need to go offline, we can make changes to the fetched branch before merging
    it into our master branch and pushing

    A git pull = fetch + merge, so use it if you do not want to make major changes 
    to origin-master and just compare it with master while merging the two files. 

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Without Git or GitHub, acess can be given to files using a cloud service to others
    but it would be really difficult to review the changes without version control
    write acess were given to everyone, unwanted changes by other users could be done 
    to our code, that is why the pull request feature of GitHub plays an important role 
    
When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    Workflow when making changes in a separate branch is more complicated than working
    directly in master, especially when you need to stay up-to-date with changes 
    others are making. Rather than simply pulling and pushing, you need to pull 
    changes into your local master branch, merge the local master into your branch 
    (different-oil, in our case), then push your branch to the remote before finally 
    merging your branch into master, either locally or on GitHub.
